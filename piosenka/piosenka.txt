Zwrotka-1

They bring him to the shore
His ship is ready made
He will not see them anymore
Here he cannot stay


Zwrotka druga jest w pliku zwrotka-2.txt

The ship glides gently on the waves
As day turns into night
One thousand burning arrows
Fill the starlit sky


Refren-1
into flame the longship burst into flames!
ack smoke is rising high
To the eternal night

Refren-2
 into flames the whole world burst    into flames!
Nothing will be the same
Things will forever change

Zwrotka-4

The flames are raging higher
They gnaw at wood and flesh
Soon the ship will break apart
And sink into the depth

Zwrotka-5

This night we drink in silence
And when the morning breaks
Our king has left this world to walk
Through Valhalla's gates

Zwrotka-6

 ravens on the longship
They spread their pitch-black wings
AndTwo lift up to the burning sky
A send-off for a king
